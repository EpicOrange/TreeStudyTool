#Constitution

Article I enumerated powers of Congress:
- regulate foreign commerce, things the Articles failed at
- elastic clause ('necessary and proper') allows for implied powers (allows for things like regulation of planes)
Article II = executive branch
Article III = judicial branch
- meant the other branches had to answer to this, they can't interpret the Constitution themselves
Article IV = full faith and credit clause: judicial decrees in one state applies to all states
Article V = amendments!
Article VI = supremacy clause: central gov't overrides state gov'ts. super important for a strong central gov't
Article VII = ignore. (it's about how to ratify the Constitution)

Limited government: Government doesn't have total power. It can't interfere for e.g. your civil liberties via force or any other way. Mostly a liberal concept
John Locke “Second Treatise”: Established three branches of government. Separation of powers.

Shay’s Rebellion: Started because of chaos that the central gov't couldn't fix (debts, mostly). Central gov't couldn't stop the rebellion without private help. Important since it showed the failure of the central gov't, galvanizing the Constitutional Convention.
Federal, Unitary, Confederate Systems: Federal = divide power between central and state gov'ts. Unitary = most power to central gov't. Confederate = most power to state gov'ts.
Federal system: Divide the power of government between strong central gov't and individual states, but central gov't is above state gov't.
Formal & informal amendment: Formally, a 2/3 vote in the states can propose an amendment, and 3/4 of states must ratify it. Informally, judicial interpretations, social change (led to New Deal after the Depression), and technological change (how do rights work on the Interwebs?) can also 'amend' the interpretation of the Constitution.


Expressed/Delegated/Enumerated powers - Powers dictated in the Constitution
Exclusive powers - Powers given only to the state or only to the federal government
Inherent powers - For-granted powers not in the Constitution, but are inherent in the idea of government (All sovereign nations have had these powers). e.g. regulating immigration, times of crisis, executive orders
Expressed Powers - The powers listed in Article I of Constitution that tell Congress what it can and can't do. Includes 'necessary and proper'
Implied powers - Powers that are 'necessary and proper'; the elastic clause







Unit 1
---

Your guided reading should be completed in three stages:
  - first, read the required and recommended material
  - second, complete the criteria for each key concept and make flashcards
  - finally, respond to the guided reading questions for the chapter, following the provided guidelines.

#Chapter 1: American Government: Roots, Context and Culture (1/5 - 1/6)
Notes:
Government - The formal vehicle through which policies are made and affairs of state are conducted
Key Concepts:
  - Limited government: Government doesn't have total power. It can't interfere for e.g. your civil liberties via force or any other way. Mostly a liberal concept
  - John Locke “Second Treatise”: Established three branches of government. Separation of powers.
  - Republic: A government rooted in the consent of the governed; a representative(indirect) democracy
  - Popular sovereignty: Idea that the ultimate authority lies within the people
  - Direct democracy: All members of the polity discuss all policy decisions, and agree to majority
  - Democracy: A system of government giving power to the people, whether directly or through representatives
  - Individual rights: The idea that people should be allowed to pursue goals (life, liberty, happiness) without being interfered with by other individuals (or government)
  - Rule of law: The idea that law gets the final word (as opposed to the word of governing individuals)
  - The Declaration of Independence: We hold the truth to be self-evident that all are created equal
Questions:
- What are the origins of American government?
  - State governments formed in the colonies, which distanced themselves from the British crown.
  - A lot of it is based on Enlightenment ideas.
  - For example, there were compromises between Hobbes' idea that people are selfish (so we need a strong central government) and Locke's idea that all people can make rational decisions and have power (so there are checks and balances to limit that power)
  - Another example is de Montesquieu's idea that there are three branches of government.
  - Articles of Confederation (1780-1787) led to death
  - After the Articles of Confederation failed to unify the colonies, a bunch of college-educated, landowning, wealthy, white politicians went to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 to make the Constitution
- What are the basic functions and tenets of American democracy?
  - Functions: separation of powers, fair elections, freedom of expression, defend right to protest and assemble, assuring minority rights while still adhering to majority rule
  - Tenets: popular sovereignty, individual rights, liberty, equality
- Why does limited government require a democratic society?
  - If it wasn't democratic, it would be hard to prevent one person from overstretching their power

#Chapter 2: The Constitution (1/6 - 1/10)
Notes:
- Article I enumerated powers of Congress:
  - regulate foreign commerce, things the Articles failed at
  - elastic clause ('necessary and proper') allows for implied powers (allows for things like regulation of planes)
- Article II = executive branch
- Article III = judicial branch
  - meant the other branches had to answer to this, they can't interpret the Constitution themselves
- Article IV = full faith and credit clause: judicial decrees in one state applies to all states
- Article V = amendments!
- Article VI = supremacy clause: central gov't overrides state gov'ts. super important for a strong central gov't
- Article VII = ignore. (it's about how to ratify the Constitution)

Key Concepts:
- Articles of Confederation: Before the constitution, there was an ineffective central gov't, but it was able to lead the US through the war. Important because its weakness highlighted the need for a better central gov't (The Constitution)
- Shay’s Rebellion: Started because of chaos that the central gov't couldn't fix (debts, mostly). Central gov't couldn't stop the rebellion without private help. Important since it showed the failure of the central gov't, galvanizing the Constitutional Convention.
- Virginia Plan and New Jersey Plan: NJP wanted to strengthen the Articles. VP wanted a more powerful central government with three branches.
- The Great Compromise: combine NJP and VP to get Senate + House of Reps
- The Federalist Papers #10 and #51: #10 said that the Constitution fixed the problems of a republic: prevent the masses from being swayed by factions. #51 said checks and balances
- Federalists and Anti-Federalists: Feds wanted unity. Anti-Feds were afraid the Feds were suppressing revolutionary ideals to get that unity, and that it would leave the states powerless. Pushed for bill of rights
- Federal, Unitary, Confederate Systems: Federal = divide power between central and state gov'ts. Unitary = most power to central gov't. Confederate = most power to state gov'ts.
- Federal system: Divide the power of government between strong central gov't and individual states, but central gov't is above state gov't.
- Checks and Balance: you know this
- Separation of Powers: you know this too
- Formal & informal amendment: Formally, a 2/3 vote in the states can propose an amendment, and 3/4 of states must ratify it. Informally, judicial interpretations, social change (led to New Deal after the Depression), and technological change (how do rights work on the Interwebs?) can also 'amend' the interpretation of the Constitution.
- The Bill of Rights: Anti-feds had a really good argument against the Constitution: rights are not protected. So this fixed that.
- Organization of the Constitution: See notes

Questions:
- What led to the colonists’ break with Great Britain?
  - Independent state governments wanted to be the only ones who could levy taxes on the colonies but GB was like nah
- Why did the Articles of Confederation fail?
  - After the war no one really wanted to support it so its powers kept getting wrecked by the states
- What compromises were central to the Constitution?
  - Great Compromise
  - 3/5 Compromise
- What are the key principles of the Constitution?
  - Divide power
  - We the people (source of power is from the people)
- How can the Constitution be amended?
  - Formally through the process or informally through changing interpretations of the Constitution
- How does the Constitution provide for and protect democracy?
  - It outlines the structure and procedures of the central government and how it will work with state governments, which allows for a fair central government that will protect the rights of people

#Chapter 3: The Federal System (1/11 - 1/19)
Notes:
Page 68 has a great chart of national, state, and concurrent (both) powers
Implied powers of Congress
  - Derivative powers from the enumerated powers
  - Necessary and proper clause
Implied powers of states
  - Everything not given to Congress

Expressed/Delegated/Enumerated powers - Powers dictated in the Constitution
Exclusive powers - Powers given only to the state or only to the federal government
Inherent powers - For-granted powers not in the Constitution, but are inherent in the idea of government (All sovereign nations have had these powers). e.g. regulating immigration, times of crisis, executive orders
Expressed Powers - The powers listed in Article I of Constitution that tell Congress what it can and can't do. Includes 'necessary and proper'
Implied powers - Powers that are 'necessary and proper'; the elastic clause

Key Concepts:
- Federalism: State and national power is shared and both come from the people
- Nullification: The right of a state to declare a federal law void
- Delegated/Enumerated Powers: All powers stated in the Constitution
- Implied Powers: Powers not stated but allowed/derived under the Constitution
- Expressed Powers: The powers listed in Article I of Constitution that tell Congress what it can and can't do
- Inherent Powers: For-granted powers not in the Constitution, but are inherent in the idea of government (All sovereign nations have had these powers). e.g. regulating immigration, times of crisis, executive orders
- Reserved Powers: All powers not given to the national government is given to the states
- Tenth Amendment: States have all powers not given to the national government (reserved powers)
- Supremacy clause: National law overrides state law
- Necessary and proper clause: Allows Congress to have implied ('necessary and proper') powers
- Full faith and credit: In Article IV. Says that one state's laws must be respected in other states. Like marriage.
- Dual and Cooperative Federalism (CAKE!): State and national power should be separate and equal, if we want the best government. Local/state/national government should also cooperate with and depend on each other because why would you not if you want a working government.
- New Federalism - devolution revolution: Reaganism, 'devolution' of power back to the states. Block grants, instead of categorical grants
- Block and Categorical grants: Block grants = federal aid, loose spending guidelines (e.g. for education, healthcare). Categorical grants = $ given based on population, for specific purposes (e.g. Medicaid) often with matching requirements (state must contribute money and federal government matches that contribution).
- Unfunded mandates: When the federal gov't tells a state to do something, without providing any financial aid. (e.g. Clean Air Act, Medicaid, No Child Left Behind)
- Programmatic requests (earmarks): Federal funds appropriated for specific projects. Given out rather than competed for, so it's kind of controversial.
- McCulloch v. Maryland: Early SC case that said fed power was above state power. Built foundation of federal power
Questions:
- How are powers allocated between federal and state governments?
  - The Constitution says that certain powers, like tariff collection, treaties, and regulating foreign trade are national powers
  - Other powers are given to state governments, like marriage laws
  - Both hold the power to: tax, borrow money, establish courts, make laws, charter banks/corporations, and provide for people
- How have dual and cooperative federalism changed the balance of power between federal and state governments?
  - Dual federalism separated powers, but set them to be equal.
- How does federalism provide for and protect democracy?

#Chapter 4: Civil Liberties (1/27 - 2/6)
Notes:

Key Concepts:
- civil liberties: rights government can't take from you
- civil rights: rights that other people aren't allowed (by government) to take from you.
- 14th Amendment: No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law
- due process clause: 14th Amendment
- substantive due process: SC said that the states have to prove that their laws are to regulate the health, welfare, or public morals of citizens. (Can't have sedition laws)
- incorporation doctrine: state and local governments also have to guarantee the rights in the Bill of Rights.
- selective incorporation: Process by which the judiciary limits the rights of states in order to protect fundamental freedoms (defined by the court)
- establishment clause: 1st Amendment, government may not have an official religion
- free exercise clause: 1st Amendment, government may not interfere with a citizen's right to practice their religion
- prior restraint: 1st Amendment, government can't prohibit speech or expression before it happens
- clear and present danger: the line defining protected and unprotected speech; e.g. Anti-war pamphlets are dangerous during wartime but ok in peacetime
- direct incitement (“fighting words”): another line, saying that speech is unprotected if it's supposed to encourage lawbreaking behavior
- symbolic speech: means of expression using symbols and signs that are protected by the Constitution (e.g. burning or flying flags)
- hate speech: communication that belittles a person or group on the basis of their characteristics
- Unprotected Speech & Press: libel/slander, fighting words, obscenity
- libel & slander: both are false speech to defames another person and are unprotected. libel = written, slander = spoken
- obscenity: basically the states define whether something is obscene by deciding whether it has no value in society
- school speech: A lot of schools have banned certain types of speech on campus but the SC hasn't really dealt with this issue yet so whether it violates the First Amendment is unclear
- 2nd Amendment: guns are allowed. debate is over whether this extends to e.g. assault weapons
- writs of habeas corpus: Article I says prisoners must be held lawfully, and they must be freed if innocent
- writ of certiorari: lower court's application to make a higher court rehear a case
- ex post facto laws: Article I says you can't make ex post facto laws, laws that punish people for doing things before the law was made
- bill of attainder: Article I says you can't make bills of attainder, laws that declare acts illegal without a trial
- 5th Amendment: everyone deserves to have a trial.
- Self incrimination: Fifth Amendment says you can't be compelled to be a witness against yourself. Judges can't interpret your lack of cooperation as evidence for guilt.
- double jeopardy: Fifth Amendment says you can't be tried a second time for the same offense.
- private property (“taking clause”): 5th Amendment says "private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation."
- 4th Amendment: no unreasonable searches or seizures, exclusionary rule
- Exclusionary rule: you can't use illegal evidence at a trial
- 6th Amendment: "speedy and public trial", also everyone deserves to have a lawyer represent them at a trial
- 8th Amendment: prevent "cruel and unusual punishment". controversial cause torture
- cruel and unusual punishment: mostly, the debate is over the death penalty
- death penalty: Debated whether this is legal. Currently it is constitutional but not for the mentally retarded or under 18
- 9th Amendment: makes it clear that the amendments aren't the only rights that should be protected by government
- right to privacy: Not an amendment, but it's implied by many amendments that privacy is supposed to be protected
Questions:
- What is the difference between civil liberties and civil rights?
  - Civil liberties and civil rights are both government-protected ideas. Civil liberties are rights government can't take from you. Civil rights are rights that other people aren't allowed (by government) to take from you.
- What role has the 14th Amendment played in the expansion of civil liberties and civil rights?
  - The 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law.
  - All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
- Why is the concept of substantive due process essential in maintaining the rights of the individual?
  - To protect the wrongly convicted and make sure people don't try super hard to convict innocent people
- Why has the Supreme Court pursued a doctrine of selective incorporation?
  - So the states aren't allowed to completely ignore the Bill of Rights but they can still have power over some rights

#Chapter 5: Civil Rights (1/27 - 2/6)
Notes:
de jure = by law
de facto = by practice

Key Concepts:
- 14th Amendment: equal protection clause
- suspect classification: A category or class that triggers strict scrutiny
- strict scrutiny: SC's higher-level standard of review for constitutionality of a practice 
- Equal Rights Amendment: Amendment that said you can't deny rights based on sex
- Equal Pay Act of 1963: Act that said men and women must have equal pay. Hard to enforce :(
- Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: 2009 legislation that women can seek redress of grievances under the Equap Pay Act
- Education Amendment, Title IX: 1972 act, Title Nine says federally funded education can't discriminate based on sex
- Defense of Marriage Act: DOMA federally defines marriage as being being 1 man 1 woman. Rejected by 2015 case ^o^
- Americans with Disabilities Act: guarantees that disabled people get access to everything. Employers cannot discriminate in hiring, and must provide for the disability
- Affirmative action: Policies designed to give attention or compensation to members of a disadvantaged group
Questions:
- What role has the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause played in the expansion of civil rights?
  - Many landmark discrimination cases, like Brown v. Board of Education, fell on the 14th Amendment of providing equal rights.
- Read “The Living Constitution” on pg. 133 and respond to the first critical thinking question provided.
  - All citizens should have basic rights but breaking laws should constitute some removal of protection of those rights. Because if you broke the law, it should stop protecting you. That being said it is still involuntary servitude to force inmates to work on a chain gang, because obviously the inmates aren't going to want to serve if they weren't being forced to.
- How did the Civil Rights Act of 1964 represent the culmination of the several civil rights movements of the previous - decades?
  - The act basically put into law the changes in practices that the civil rights movements campaigned for.
- Explain the difference between de facto and de jure discrimination and which one is harder to successfully address?
  - De jure is legal discrimination, while de facto is discrimination due to practices. De jure is easy since you just need to say it's unconstitutional based on the fourteenth amendment. De facto is hard since you have to prove there's discrimination in the first place.
- How does the Supreme Court’s constitutional standards of review both help and hinder groups that are fighting for legal restitution against discrimination? (see table on pg. 151)
  - Certain acts of discrimination are prevented when the SC hands down decisions that effectively prohibit discriminatory practices that weren't prohibited before. These are done through review of the Constitution.
  - However, having lower standards of review for certain things like sexual orientation makes it difficult to stop discriminatory practices related to sexual orientation.





Unit 2

Your guided reading should be completed in three stages:
  - first, read the required and recommended material
  - second, complete the criteria for each key concept and make flashcards
  - finally, respond to the guided reading questions for the chapter, following the provided guidelines.




Chapter 10: Public Opinion & Political Socialization
----------------------------------------------------
Notes:
  - Most polls are stratified because then they represent voting population more
Key Concepts:
  - public opinion polls - polls designed to survey what people think about issues or candidates
  - sample - it's important to take samples correctly i guess
  - straw poll - unofficial poll of opinion
  - push poll - polls designed to make people vote against a candidate
  - exit poll - polls given to people as they exit the polling site
  - tracking poll - horse race coverage. track an election as it goes
  - shortcomings of polls
    - margin of error (usually 4%) comes from the fact that samples don't perfectly show a population
    - sampling error is doing a sample wrong
    - there are limited respondent options
    - respondents have a lack of information on the topic being surveyed ("don't know" options)
    - can't measure intensity of a political issue
    - lack of interest (e.g. with foreign issues, compared to with domestic issues)
  - political socialization - The process through which people acquire their beliefs
  - demographic characteristics - gender, race/ethnicity, age, religion
  - external forces - family, peers, school, mass media, leaders who urge the people to do something, political knowledge or lack thereof

Questions:

- What criteria are necessary for an accurate poll?
  - representative sample, 
- What are the different types of polls and how accurately do they measure public opinion?
  - 
- How might frequent fluctuations in the results of public opinion polls both help and hurt candidates?
  - 
- What are the factors that impact our political socialization?
  - 
- Examine the data on pg. 318: Which gaps are the largest? Smallest? Why do you think these differences exist?
  - 
- Read The Living Constitution on pg. 321 and respond to the two critical thinking questions.
  - 
- Use our Community Data and the reading from chapter 10 to respond to the following questions:
  - 
- Question #1 Using the specific language of polling analysis from Chpt 10.2-10.3 and your understanding about polls from that reading explain why OUR community group data is NOT a valid poll.
  - 
- Question #2: Compare our community results to the general public: What accounts for the differences? Brainstorm ideas (you may want to look at pgs. 313 & 318 to get additional data and ideas)
  - 


Chapter 1.6: Political Ideology 
-------------------------------
Notes:
  - Conservatives
    - don't want fast change in gov't, and only when necessary
    - value fiscal responsibility (balanced budgets in gov't)
    - favor local action, not federal, since the private sector is better equipped and more efficient at dealing with shit
  - Social conservatives
    - believe that morals need to be upheld so use government to stop people from being themselves
  - Liberals
    - Believes in the ability of the government to change and develop the status quo politically, economically, and socially
    - Opposes excessive regulation, and opposes on infringement of civil rights and liberties. Values equality
  - Moderates
    - believe a moderate viewpoint is the best because it's between two extremes
Questions:
- What are the essential differences between liberals and conservatives?
  - Conservatives don't believe in the power of the government while liberals do.
  - Conservatives promote restricting equality for morals' sake but liberals oppose that
- Examine Take A Closer Look on pg. 20 and respond to critical thinking question #1.
  - How does reducing political ideology to two dimensions -- economic and personal freedom -- help to simplify our understandings of politics? What information does it leave out?
    - It's useful because it describes the ideologies in terms of economic or personal freedom, which can be determined by the nature of certain beliefs (i.e. welfare).
    - It leaves out certain subgroups by encompassing e.g. all conservatives into one categroy
    - It also discounts a possible mix of beliefs. A conservative may hold a very liberal belief in one area, like healthcare





Chapter 11: Political Parties
-----------------------------
Notes:
- Political party organization: voters -> activists -> city/county committees -> congressional district committees -> state committees -> national convention(rigged bullshit every 4 yrs) -> national committee(DNC/RNC) -> national chair

Key Concepts:
  - candidate-centered politics
  - party realignment
  - critical election
  - political party organization - see notes
  - delegate - representative to the party convention
  - superdelegate - a party official who doesn't pledge their vote to a candidate
  - party platform
  - parties in government
  - party identification - a citizen's personal affinity for a political party. Influenced most by parents, but also by group affiliations such as geography, gender, race/ethnicity, age, socioeconomic factors(occupation, income, education), religion, and marital status.
  - two-party system - you know this
  - Democratic Party
  - Republican Party
  - minor parties - 3rd parties. Libertarian is fastest-growing; yet they have had limited success
  - proportional representation - many European countries apportion legislative seats based on proportion of votes
  - winner-take all - US says winning by one vote win all; makes it hard to have more parties than minimum (2)
  - polarization - increasingly conflicting and divided viewpoints of political parties. hurts compromise, built on Congressional battles and in political campaigns (stereotypes for example), also by forcing moderates to choose

Questions:

- What is the connection between political socialization and party identification?
  - Political socialization is the process through which people acquire their beliefs, and these beliefs can match up with one party which applies a party identification to that set of beliefs
- What are the various group affiliations associated with party identification?
  - geography, gender, race/ethnicity, age, socioeconomic factors(occupation, income, education), religion, and marital status
- Describe the formal structures of the political parties.
  - 
- What role do informal groups play in political parties?
  - Informal groups can provide money, labor, or other assistance to a political party. Most importantly, they help mobilize individuals for a party.
- What are the four major functions of political parties? Which of these functions do you think is essential for preserving and strengthening our democratic system?
  - Running candidates for office
  - Formulating and promoting policy
  - Organizing government branches together
  - Furthering unity, linkage, and accountability (branches, party identification)
- What role do minor parties (also known as third parties) play in our political system and what barriers do they face?
  - 
- Look at Explore Your World on pg.336 and respond to critical thinking question #3
  - 





Chapter 12: Elections & Voting
------------------------------
Notes:
- Retrospective judgement - voting for party based on past performance (important for incumbent re-election)
- Prospective judgement - voting for party based on what they pledge to do
Key Concepts:
  - electorate - body of all citizens who are eligible to vote
  - mandate - winners claim a mandate (command) from the voters to carry out their agenda
  - primary election - voters decide which candidates will represent the party
  - ballot measure - allows voters to enact policy. they are the initiative and the referendum
  - initiative - proposed legislation/amendments submitted to popular vote by individual citizens of a state
  - referendum - proposed legislation/amendments submitted to popular vote by the state
  - general election - after primary selects which candidates are candidates, general election selects the actual one for the position
  - caucuses - parties advertise their candidates and then people cast a well-informed vote
  - Electoral College - the representatives who actually elect the president
  - reapportionment - reassignment of House seats every 10 years to reflect population shifts
  - incumbent - person who already holds office. holds advantage due to staff support, visibility, 'scare-off effect' aka oh jeebz they have experience
  - presidential coattails - one way incumbents lose; president is a different party than you are so out you go
  - mid-term elections - another way incumbents lose; some people don't like the president and can't elect a new one so they kick off the incumbents (especially in the 6th year of a presidency)
  - ticket-splitting - when your ticket says you're voting for candidates of more than one party
  - ideology - liberal/conservative
  - voter turnout (12.6) - see questions below
  - voter eligibility - you need to be at least 18, a US citizen, and a resident of your state (includes homeless)
  - voter registration - you gotta register as a voter before you can vote...

Questions:

- What are the factors that influence which candidates an individual chooses to support?
  - Party, ideology, income/education, race/ethnicity, gender, religion, issues
  - Low education tend to vote Democrat. Bachelor's tend to vote Republican. Graduate tend to vote Democrat.
  - Females are 5-7% more likely to vote Democrat
  - Protestants tend to vote for Republicans (social conservatives)
  - Everyone but whites tend to vote Democrat (Blacks notably so, like 90% or something)
- What factors affect voter turnout?
  - Income/education, race/ethnicity, gender, age, civic engagement, interest in politics
  - Can't vote as often if you have low income
  - Whites tend to vote more
  - Women tend to vote slightly more (also bc there are more women in the US population)
  - Young tend to not vote; likely since they haven't had the time to develop strong beliefs
  - Higher civic engagement (people in labor unions for example) tend to vote more
  - People who are very engaged in politics are like only 5% of the population
- Explain why voter turnout in the US is lower compared to most other advanced democracies.
  - US has a focus on work and busyness. So schedule conflicts is a big factor
  - Difficulty of registration is another. To vote, you have to register (unlike in other democracies where the government helps all people register). Motor voter act helps a lot.
  - Ballot access laws intended to prevent fraudulent voting actually make it harder to vote. (e.g. having to have a photo ID) This is prevalent in the South.
  - US has too many elections which is kind of discouraging
  - Weakened influence of political parties (today, they appear more bureaucratic than grassroots) makes people care less about politics
- Of the proposed ways to improve voter turnout, which one do you think would be the most effective and which least effective?
  - Make election day a holiday since Tuesday is stupid
  - *Enable early voting* <-- probably most effective, does away with a lot of excuses
  - Permit mail and online voting
  - Make registration easier
  - Modernize the ballot (paper???)
  - *Strengthen parties* <-- probably least effective, it might disincentivize people from politics if it becomes so polar
- Explain the difference between types of elections.
  - 
- Which type of election do you think is better for picking a party nominee, primaries or caucuses and why?
  - 
- Should the Electoral College continue to play a role in the selection of the president? If yes why? If no, why not and what reform would you propose?
  - 
- What are the advantages of incumbency in Congressional elections?
  - Advantages includes name recognition, ability to claim responsibility, ease in fundraising due to trust
- When do those incumbency advantages not matter and why?

Chapter 13: The Campaign Process
--------------------------------
Notes:
- Political campaigns are split into two parts.
  - Nomination campaign is for the primary election
  - General election campaign is for the general election (for office)
- Campaign finance
  - Regulation of $$$ pouring into campaigns included the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA)
  - $$$ can come from individuals, political parties, personal savings (self-financing), political action committees (PACs), 527 political committees, 501(c) groups, and Super PACs.
    - PACs can contribute directly to campaigns; contributions are limited though
    - 527s influence electoral outcomes (not usually tied to specific candidates). e.g. Citizens United. Little regulation
    - 501(c) groups raise awareness of candidates' positions; don't have to disclose sources of donations
    - Super PACs make independent expenditures (must not be coordinated with campaign); must disclose sources of donations
- Campaign ads
  - positive ads improve a candidate's image, negative ads hurt the other's image
  - contrast ads compare the candidates but bias towards the one sponsoring the ads
  - inoculation ads attempt to block negative ads by telling the truth first
Key Concepts:
  - campaign - see notes
  - pollster - campaign consultants who conducts public opinion surveys
  - campaign finance - see notes
  - Citizens United v. FEC - ruled that corporations are people too; can't limit spending since that limits free speech
  - Super PACs - make independent expenditures (must not be coordinated with campaign); must disclose sources of donations
  - PACs - political action committees. can contribute directly to campaigns
  - 527 political committee - influences electoral outcomes
  - 501(c) group - raises awareness of candidate positions
  - public funds - donations from general tax revenues to the campaigns of presidential candidates
  - campaign advertisements - campaign strat. see notes
  - party convention - 

Questions:

- What distinguishes the nomination campaign from the general election campaign?
  - Nomination is when party members fight each other to be the general election candidate.
  - General election is when parties fight each other for office.
- Identify and explain the key roles in a campaign staff and how those individuals could make a difference between victory and losing.
  - Campaign manager runs everything and plans all the strats. Intense job
  - Finance chair raises money, keeps records of money, and does paperwork
  - Communications staff does media, including Internet. Works with press secretary (who contacts journalists)
  - Campaign consultants are private professionals/firms that work for the candidate. They can do things like polls and fundraising.
  - Volunteers solicit votes, answer calls, staff booths, all the grunt work
- What role does the media play in campaigns?
  - Lots. News media are always on top of the campaign and investigate everything (like rumors).
  - Media hosts debates, which are important.
  - Modern tech allows for things like Internet, and especially ads
  - Look up 'media effects'
- How do candidates attempt to control their image and message in the media and why do they succeed and fail in doing so?
  - Campaign staff can stage events for the media. They shield the candidate from the media in case the candidate slips up.
  - Campaign can also try to 'spin' events (any event!) to put their candidate in a positive light.
  - Candidates can appear on talk shows to express their views (rather than be asked questions by reporters)






Chapter 14: The News Media
--------------------------
Notes:
Key Concepts:
  - mass media - all organizations which collect and organize information for consumption by the general public
  - narrowcasting - when media targets specific populations within society. e.g. target only for Republicans
  - content regulations - gov't regulates electronic media because it wants to make it less biased (e.g. must give equal airtime to all candidates).
  - citizen journalists - ordinary individuals who do media (collect, report, analyze news). They have become increasingly popular and represent a democratic factor to media; however they are rarely objective or reliable.
  - news media influence - news media is the part of mass media that deals with news e.g. elections and influence opinion on e.g. elections.

Questions:

- How does the media go about covering the government?
  - The presidency is most important in the media and is often swamped. That's why the President has a press secretary to deal with journalists.
  - Congress is so big that no one can cover every member.
    - Nevertheless they try and they do that by splitting into 3 groups.
    - First group: leaders of both houses
    - Second group: key f
     chairs
    - Third group: local senators and reps
  - SC definitely gets the least attention. This is good with the SC since they don't want to be politically biased, or to "play to the crowd".
- How well do you think their coverage is in terms of providing relevant information?
  - I don't know, I stopped following media since Trump became everywhere and it started to become hard to find news about tech.
- What are the major influences the media has on our political system?
  - Media can put a certain 'spin' on any issue which helps align people towards a more liberal or more conservative side.
- Why is public confidence in the media essential to our democracy?
  - According to the textbook, public confidence in the media has been trending negative since the 1980s.
  - Although a majority of Americans don't trust in the accuracy/objectivity of the media, the media has higher approval ratings than other political institutions and people believe that "the press keeps political leaders from wrongdoing".
  - So confidence in the press is important in a democratic society if the democratic society wants to make sure that people are not corrupt.







Chapter 15: Interest Groups
---------------------------
Notes:
Key Concepts:
  - types of interest group - ???
  - pluralist theory - political power is distributed across diverse, competing interest groups
  - disturbance theory - interest groups form due to changes in the political system
  - transactions theory - opposed to pluralist theory. Political power is a result of transactions across political actors
  - interest group actions - see question 2
  - lobbying - persuading political leaders to follow your interests
  - election activities - see question 2

Questions:

- What are the key strategies of interest groups and which one do you think is most effective in achieving the group’s goal?
  - lobbying the executive branch. lobbying the courts. grassroots lobbying. protests and activism (think Boston Tea Party).
  - in elections: endorsements. helping people vote. rating candidates. throwing money at candidates.
  - I think it depends. For civil rights, lobbying the courts had the most immediate effect, while grassroots lobbying slowly but fundamentally changed opinion which was also important.
  - But for e.g. SOPA/PIPA there was a lot of protest on the Internet which got to a lot of people.
- How do interest groups attempt to influence elections and voter behavior?
  - Interest groups bring people together so they can be more politically motivated. In particular, they increase political participation.
- What are the factors that make an interest group successful and effective?
  - The goal is to shape the public agenda. If you do that, you're successful and effective.
  - Factors include good leadership, funding/patrons, and the kinds of members.
    - Three kinds of interest group members: people who just say they're members, people who actually get out and do things, and people who lad
  - Small groups can encourage more activism since each member can feel like they're actually contributing
  - Free rider problem: when all benefits from a group, people may be less likely to join the group because what's the point if they get its benefits regardless?

Chapter 7: The Presidency
-------------------------
Notes:
Key Concepts:
  - Presidential Qualifications - Natural-born citizen; At least 35yo; Resident for at least 14 yrs
  - Executive privilege - Implied presidential power that allows the president to refuse to disclose confidential information (e.g. for national defense) to the other branches
  - 22nd Amendment - Made it so the President can't serve more than two terms (or terms totalling to more than ten years); made after Roosevelt's 4 term tenure
  - 25th Amendment - Established procedures for filling vacancies for pres and VP; VP also becomes acting president if President is incapacitated
  - U.S. v. Nixon - Executive privilege can't override court orders to produce information for trials
  - Cabinet - Formal body of advisers who lead the 15 executive departments + a few personal picks by the President
  - Constitutional powers of the President
    - appointment - President can appoint officers and judges of the Supreme Court. This can be used to indicate the President's policy interests
    - treaties - Treaties can only be made by the President since the President represents the US
    - executive agreements - It's a (secret) treaty presidents can make that are only binding for the current president. presidents normally need Senate to approve all treaties, but executive agreements don't need this. Use of executive agreements is supported by the courts.
    - veto - Ability to reject a bill. Often forces Congress to create a bill that President might accept.
    - line-item veto - Ability to delete part of a bill. Authorized in 1996 but was declared unconstitutional because it gave too many powers
    - commander in chief of the military - important executive power
    - pardon - Ability to release an individual from a crime before or after conviction for any crime except impeachment.
    - inherent powers - Powers granted to the president that can be inferred from the Constitution (like conducting diplomatic relations)
  - Roles of the President - Chief law enforcer; Leader of the party; Commander in chief; Shaper of public policy; Key player in the legislative process; Chief of state
  - Vice President - basically a replacement for the President when there is no able Presidents. Otherwise has like no power unless the President gives them power (which has been increasing recently)
  - Executive Office of the President (EOP) - the President's bureaucracy of advisers and offices, established by FDR to enforce New Deal. Presidents appoint these offices so they can indicate their policy preferences through appointment.
  - White House Staff - Usually more responsible to the President than the EOP. Helps with administrative tasks.
  - Presidential power & public opinion - If the public has a high opinion of the President, the President can push legislation through Congress (e.g. after 9/11, Bush pushed the USA PATRIOT Act). Low opinion makes it hard for the President to do anything
  - President & policy making - Presidents play the role of setting the legislative agenda
    - executive order - a rule set forth by the President (does not require congressional approval)
    - signing statements - the President can add a comment on signed bills, which has an effect on the legislation
Questions
  - What are the formal qualifications and term of office for the President?
    - Natural-born citizen
    - At least 35yo
    - Resident for at least 14 yrs
  - What are the various tools and changes that have been made over the history of the US to reign in the power of the president? 
    - 22nd Amendment (2 terms) and 25th Amendment (address incapacitated executives) and US v Nixon (Exec can't refuse court order)
  - What types of situations seem to spark the attempt to reign in the president’s power?
    - ignore this question
  - Read The Living Constitution on pg. 211 and respond to question #2.
    - Is it appropriate in a representative democracy to ever have a situation in which both the president and the vice president have not been popularly elected?
  - Briefly describe the major powers of the president. Identify which of those powers serves as a check on the power of the other two branches.
    - appointment, treaties, executive agreements (aka secret treaties), vetos, pardon, diplomatic relations
    - Appointment is a check on the legislative branch because appointing people tells the legislative branch what kind of laws will be enforced
  - Read through Take A Closer Look on pg. 214 and respond to the three Critical Thinking questions.
    - 2. How are these roles derived from the enumerated powers of the presidency? How are they enhanced by the president's inherent powers?
    - 3. How has the balance of power between these roles changed over time? Which roles have become more and less important, and why?
  - Explain the role of the president in making policy. 
    - Presidents can make executive orders which is a rule set forth by the President without congressional approval. SC can challenge this.
    - E.g. Truman ending segregation in the military, Lyndon B. Johnson making affirmative action a national policy
    - Presidents can make signing statements on bills they sign. Usually they just sign the bill and write a comment. But sometimes they have to sign the bill because they know Congress really wants it, but if the President doesn't want it, then this 'comment' can be like 'None of this bill is gonna be enforced by me' and this actually has an effect on official policy.
  - How can this policy making role be used to expand the powers of the presidency?
    - They can be used to sidestep Congress' ability to limit the presidency's powers, since the presidency can use executive orders and signing statements to become basically a limited legislative branch
  - Examine the graphic and explanations about public approval on pg. 228. How does this information demonstrate that the power of the president is based primarily on public opinion and not necessarily on what is articulated in the Constitution.
    - lol does this need explanation
  - Now look at [President Trump’s current job approval ratings](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html). How will these impact his ability to get his proposed budget through Congress?
    - His job approval ratings are lowering fast which means it's hard for him to do anything


Chapter 8: The Executive Branch & the Federal Bureaucracy
---------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
Key Concepts:
  - federal bureaucracy - 
  - spoils system - system of employment where you fire everyone and replace them with your own friends, family, party (to reward for support)
  - patronage - rewarding support with offices
  - merit system - system of employment based on qualifications rather than loyalty
  - Pendleton Act - After Garfield's death (he proposed the merit system) this act in 1883 established the merit system to stop spoils system
  - civil service system - merit system for federal bureaucrats
  - independent regulatory commission - Entity created by Congress outside executive department, usually to regulate commerce and intended to be neutral experts rather than political jerks; opposite of EOP, e.g. the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
  - Cabinet departments - Major administrative units with responsibility for a broad area of government operations, accounting for 60% of federal workforce. There are 15 rn; important ones are Department of State, Department of the Treasury, Department of Defense, Department of Justice
  - independent executive agencies - When people don't want to put things like NASA or EPA as under a department, they make it an independent executive agency which is like the same thing as a department but narrower responsibility. One difference is departments are regulatory, while IEAs give services
  - government corporations - Gov't can make corporations, which provide services for a fee. E.g. the Tenessee Valley Authority provides reduced-rate electricity
  - Hatch Act - 1939, prohibited federal employees from working for political candidates while on duty
  - iron triangles - Strong relationship between federal workers, interest groups, and congressional committees. Used to dominate but now few survive (e.g. veterans groups). In other words: Bureaucracy, Corporations, Congress
  - issue networks - relationships among people who work in broad policy areas
  - power of the bureaucracy - All of the bureaucracy is focused on policy-making.
    - Administrative descretion - they can say what the best way to implement gov't intentions are. basically executive.
    - rule-making - making regulations, basically legislative.
    - administrative adjucation - bureaucracy can resolve disputes on rules they are enforcing, which is basically judicial.
  - accountability of the bureaucracy - 
Questions

    - 

Chapter 9: The Judiciary
-----------------------
Notes:
Key Concepts:
  - original jurisdiction - courts that have original jurisdiction (trial courts) determine the facts of the case; SC has original jurisdiction in cases involving state gov'ts or public officials (specified in Article III section 2). Note only 1-3% of cases heard in the SC are of original jurisdiction
  - appellate jurisdiction - courts that have appellate jurisdiction (appellate courts) review and revise cases already determined in a lower court. SC has appellate jurisdiction in every other case
  - Judiciary Act of 1789 - created the system; federal district courts (trial courts) at the bottom, circuit courts (appellate courts) in the middle to review the lower courts, and then the Supreme Court
  - judicial review - power of the courts to review acts of other branches of gov't and the states
    - Marbury v. Madison - established that the supremacy clause implies judicial review, something that was not explicitly in the Constitution
  - court system
    - trial courts - courts of original jurisdiction where cases begin
    - appellate courts - courts that generally reviews only findings of law made by lower courts
    - legislative (Article I) courts - Federal courts, created by Congress and the Constitution, e.g. US territorial courts (which hear courts for territories)
    - constitutional (Article III) courts - Federal courts for specialized purposes like Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims
  - precedents - prior judicial decisions that serves as a rule for settling similar subsequent cases. The SC sets precedents for the entire nation.
  - stare decisis - 'let the decision stand'; the reliance on precedents to settle new cases. Not always followed, sometimes precedents are overruled!
  - federal judicial appointments - president appoints, lobbyists influence the Senate who then votes to confirm
  - writ of certiorari - a request (can be denied) for the SC to review records from lower courts. Cases must come from a court of appeals, district court, or state court of last resort; and it must involve a federal question.
  - Rule of Four - to grant certiorati, four justices must vote to hear the case
  - amicus curiae - a 'friend of the court'; a party involved in cases that the SC hears, e.g. the solicitor general. Interest groups can file amicus briefs for a case, improving the chance that the case is accepted by the SC
  - judicial decision making
    - Oral arguments: Each attorney gets 30m to present their case to the panel of SC justices; it is more of a Q&A rather than a speech. This happens throughout the week
    - Closed conferences: Court meets twice a week to participate in conference sessions, which is when they decide what to vote. The justices also try to convince each other during these conferences.
    - Written opinions: After making the decision, one justice on the majority will write the majority opinion. Justices may also file concurring opinions if they agree with the decision but not with the reasoning; they may file dissenting opinions if they disagree with the decision. Concurring opinions and dissenting opinions have little legal value over the majority opinion.
  - judicial restraint - philosophy that courts should allow the decisions of other branches to stand, even when they offend a judge's own principles. Rationale is that the judiciary is the least democratic branch
  - judicial activism - the opposing philosophy that judges should use their power to further justice (e.g. civil rights)
  - strict constructionist - an approach to constitutional interpretation that emphasizes interpreting the Constitution as originally written. This aligns with judicial restraint and is the opposite of loose constructionist, which is basically judicial activism
Question
  - How is the US court system organized? Describe the United States’ dual court system and the types of cases each court has jurisdiction over.
    - Two types of jurisdiction
      - original jurisdiction - courts that have original jurisdiction (trial courts) determine the facts of the case; 
      - appellate jurisdiction - courts that have appellate jurisdiction (appellate courts) review and revise cases already determined in a lower court.
    - Federal district courts are the bottom layer and they only have original jurisdiction
    - Circuit courts are in the middle layer and they only have appellate jurisdiction
    - SC is at the top.
      - SC has original jurisdiction in cases involving state gov'ts or public officials (specified in Article III section 2).
      - SC has appellate jurisdiction in every other case.
      - Note only 1-3% of cases heard in the SC are of original jurisdiction.
    - 'dual' court system is because states get one system (described above), and SC is the other system.
